# FirstRepo
This is the first repository I have created. Thank you for your time if you are reading this.

This project was created to build familiarity with Git and GitHub, and to provide persons with grande home libraries a way to catalogue and analyze them. The first test subject for this project lies within my own household. At the inception of this README file I stare at two bookcases begging for siblings, as stacks of unshelved works threaten to fall over on the carpet indented by the weight of these placeless legacies.

With this program, you can:
12/20/2021
- Catalogue books by entering Title, Author, Genre, Year of Publication, (whether it is a) Hardcover (or not), and (keep track of whether you have) Read (it or not)
- Have visualized for you the distribution of your library by genre
- Have a (gentle) reminder of the percentage of books within each genre that is unread
- Maintain a CSV file of your library, so as to:
  + stop buying duplicates (different cover art not included in this, of course)
  + check which volumes within series you have
  + stop buying duplicates 
  + STOP BUYING DUPLICATES

This will be the main project file, upon which branches with edits can be created. Let us achieve organization together.
